Long long ago in a forest there lived a tortoise and a hair
 Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow. "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh. 
 "Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it.
 " The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed.
